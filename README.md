Snipped from beautiful [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com.tr/intl/tr/earth/versions/#download-pro) (Seriously just use it for 
exploring, 10/10 activity would recommend.)

The report can be found [here.](https://github.com/kantarcise/Microwave-Radiolink-Design/blob/master/Project.pdf)

It is written in Turkish, so i will do my very best to explain it throughly in this readme.
