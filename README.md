Snipped from beautiful [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com.tr/intl/tr/earth/versions/#download-pro) (Seriously just use it for 
exploring, 10/10 activity would recommend.)

The report can be found [here.](https://github.com/kantarcise/Microwave-Radiolink-Design/blob/master/Project.pdf)

It is written in Turkish, so i will do my very best to explain it throughly in this readme.

## Introduction

So this project was about designing a ground to ground microwave radiolink. While there are a lot things to consider in this design, an 
whole a lot of stuff that could go wrong; with some procedures, we can design a link that is robust and well built.

As an engineer, we have to think in **margins**, and apply a perspective of a "test engineer" to our design; before it is even 
considered to be realized. In a Microwave Radiolink, things that could form an issue are thus:

+ Center Frequency
+ Bandwidth
+ Link Profile
+ Weather Conditions
+ Possible Fading Probabilities
+ Tower Building Capabilities
+ Frequency Plan

All of these points need to be thought of throughly, as they are crucial for our design.

## Design

The design started, with the idea of development purpose. Two small countryside villages chosen from the North of Turkey; and thought 
process were designing a 1500 user telephone link between these villages with two dish antenna towers. If needed there would be 
diversity; which actually ended up being used space diversity to improve the avalibility of the link.
